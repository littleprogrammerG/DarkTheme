# What is this?
This is a switch to toggle between dark and light mode.\
I made this as a project to later incorparate in my website.

I created this design based off [neumorphism][1].\
Also, I modified Lichin's [UI kit][2] for [my design][3].

## SVGs used:
[Sun SVG][4]\
[Moon SVG][5]\
I changed the stroke color and the size.
